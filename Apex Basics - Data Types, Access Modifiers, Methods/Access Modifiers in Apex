//Access Modifiers in Apex

/*
Access modifiers are keywords that control the visibility and accessibility of classes, methods, variables, and constructors in an application. 

They are a fundamental part of object-oriented programming and help to create encapsulated code, which is safer and easier to maintain.
*/


1) private - By Default private is the access modifier (if no modifier is specified). Method and Variables are accessible only within the Apex Class in which it is defined.

2) protected - This means that the method or variable is visible to any inner classes in the defining Apex class, and to the classes that extend the defining Apex class.

This can only be used for instance methods and member variables. (member variables - consider Toy Box is a class and differnt toys like Car, Truck etc are the member variables of that toy box/ class.)

3) public - This means that the method or variable is accessible by all Apex within a specific package.

4) global - This means the method or variable can be used by any Apex code that has access to the class, not just the Apex code in the same application. 
This access modifier must be used for any method that must be referenced outside of the application, either in SOAP API or by other Apex code. 
If you declare a method or variable as global, you must also declare the class that contains it as global.
