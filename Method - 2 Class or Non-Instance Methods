//Class Declaration

Public Class Bird {

//Declaration of Class Variables 

Public Static String name = 'Crow';
Public Static Integer age = 2;


// Method Declaration
Public Static Void Fly()
{
System.debug(Bird.name + ' is flying');
}


}


//Explanation

// The above class is having Class Variables / Non-instance Variables along with an Class Method.
// Hence, there is no requirement to create a new object to run the class and print the output
// we can directly call the method with the classname 


//Use of the Static keyword -
//The static keyword is used to associate a variable or method with a class rather than a specific instance of the class. 

// Use of Class Variables - One time memory allocation



//code in the Anon Window

//Bird.Fly();


//output
//Crow is flying
